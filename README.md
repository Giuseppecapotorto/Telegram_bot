# Telegram Bot Hackex 
 # ðŸŽ® Project

This project is dedicated to all those who, like me, are passionate about telegram bots and programming in general. Nothing too complicated, you will find all the material needed to create telegram bots of any size from the most complex to the simplest. This bot has a carefully divided structure and is used to assist telegram group managers.

# ðŸ‘£ Objectives 

1. Assist group managers.
2. Have a base to start from, as it is implementable.
3. Entertain as it offers reactions to some answers.
4. Ban and warn users.
5. Evaluate user behavior through a bad word counter.

# ðŸ¤© Creation 

Download Requirements.txt to start using the Telegram Bot Api libraries and create the bots you like. To solve the problem due to dependencies, you can create a virtual Python environment to isolate them. Requirements.txt should preferably be entered from the command line of the Windows PC or Visual Studio Code terminal.

# ðŸ‘¾ Virtual_Envoirment 

To create a virtual environment you need to open the terminal and type:
- cd dekstop 
- mkdir <your folder>
- cd <your folder>
- python -m venv <your folder>
- <your folder> \ Script\ Activate 
- Requirements.txt
- New <File.py>
